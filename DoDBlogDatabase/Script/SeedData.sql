('Top 6 things to avoid or consider when buying an Ultrabook'
		,'About to drop $1000+ on that brand new laptop? Here are a few things to keep in mind before making that jump.'
		,'Though this is far from being an inclusive list, we want buyers to keep an open mind on other key factors of a laptop beyond just thinness, first impressions and price. The following applies largely to Ultrabooks as gaming laptops and business laptops will have their own special sets of considerations and cautions.

1. Avoid 768p Display Options
Major OEMs like Lenovo, HP and Dell like to offer a very range of display options from 768p all the way up to 4K UHD. Other than the more attractive starting price, however, 768p should be avoided in most circumstances. Not only is the resolution lower than 1080p, almost all 768p panels also tend to be more poorly calibrated with shallower colors, poorer contrast ratios, dimmer backlights, and narrower viewing angles. The end result is an ugly visual experience in more ways than just resolution when compared to 1080p or greater.

2. Consider USB Type-C Charging
The USB Type-C standard was supposed to consolidate what we love about standard USB Type-A and then some. Unfortunately, USB Type-C has since branched into a huge mess of multiple standards with some ports supporting Gen. 1 speeds, Gen. 2 speeds, DisplayPort, Thunderbolt 3, or charging all depending on the laptop in question. Out of all these auxiliary features, charging over USB is one of favorites as it allows you to recharge the laptop with almost any inexpensive third-party USB Type-C charger. It''s a feature you''ll be glad to have especially when traveling or if you happen to lose the original charger. '

		('Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Extreme 2019 Laptop Review'
		,'Everything the same? New CPUs, a faster GPU and a greater choice of displays, that is the ThinkPad X1 Extreme Gen 2 in a nutshell. Lenovo has only slightly modified the second-generation model, with the chassis remaining unchanged for this year''s model. We have put the device through its paces, specifically the one with a matte 4K panel, which has a massive impact on battery life. Update: X1 Extreme is equipped with the GTX 1650 Max-Q after all'
		,'It has only been a year since Lenovo entered the premium multimedia laptop market, with the ThinkPad X1 Extreme competing against the Dell XPS 15, the HP Spectre x360 15 and the Apple MacBook Pro 15. The company''s first attempt convinced us with the usual qualities of ThinkPads, while its numerous security features made the device interesting for consumers and professionals alike.

Since then, Lenovo has released a second generation, with which it equipped updated components and new displays options. Since almost nothing has changed visually this year, we shall refer you to our review of last year''s model for our thoughts here. The same applies to the ports and input devices that the X1 Extreme Gen 2 offers. Alternatively, we have also reviewed the ThinkPad P1 2019, the workstation offshoot of the X1 Extreme. The ThinkPad P1 2019 and X1 Extreme Gen 2 share the same chassis, ports and connectivity, for reference.

Update 03/06/2020: Nvidia now confirmed that the second generation of the ThinkPad X1 Extreme is equipped with the Max-Q version of the GeForce GTX 1650. The designation is supposed to be corrected with the next driver version. However, we still have no official answer from Lenovo. The fact that official spec sheets list different versions is highly irritating for potential customers and should be fixed.'

		('The Android 10 rollout for the Nokia 6.2 and Nokia 7.2 has been delayed'
		,'The Nokia 7.2 was originally promised to get the Android 10 update in Q1 2020. We''re at the end of Q1, however, and that plan appears to have been scrapped with official confirmation that the phone will receive the update in Q2 instead.'
		,'Nokia—HMD Global, if you want to get technical—has been one of the major flagbearers for the Android One program. While we remain skeptical of the real-world benefits of the program, Android One is designed to provide timely, consistent updates. Nokia has managed to mostly deliver on that end, but the company''s Android 10 rollout looks to have been met with some slight issues.

The company launched the Nokia 6.2 and Nokia 7.2 in September last year, and promised that the phones would receive the Android 10 update in the first quarter of 2020. Well, we''re already in the last month of the quarter and neither phone has received the Android 10 update. The Finnish company recently revealed an updated Android 10 release roadmap that had the Nokia 6.2, Nokia 7.2, and all the other third-gen phones listed to get the update at the tail end of this month.

It''s unlikely that the company will be able to meet up with that schedule for the Nokia 6.2 and Nokia 7.2, however. A user on XDA-Developer has provided a screenshot showing confirmation from a Nokia customer service rep that the Nokia 7.2 will receive the Android 10 update in Q2. We expect that timeline to hold true for the company''s other devices listed for a late-March Android 10 rollout.'

		('The best video smartphones in the test: All against the iPhone'
		,'Action! We test the best smartphones for videography and let them compete against each other in a direct comparison. The iPhone 11 Pro is considered to be the top device in this discipline, but the competition in the form of the Galaxy Note 10+, Mate 30 Pro, and Xiaomi Mi Note 10 can also convince. Find out which is the top smartphone in the review.'
		,'The iPhone has the reputation of being the first choice for video recordings and offers a wide range of options in this regard. The competition from the Android warehouse has been upgraded and has legitimate ambitions to contest the Apple phone for the throne.

Huawei even integrates an additional 40 MP image sensor, while Samsung uses a very similar setting to Apple in the Galaxy Note 10 Plus. The Xiaomi Mi Note 10 is much cheaper, but with a swanky 108 MP sensor it nominally opens the widest shooter. The upcoming Galaxy S20 series would certainly also be an exciting candidate because the devices can handle 8K video, among other things, but unfortunately they were not yet available at the time of testing.'

		('First Snapdragon 865 benchmarks reveal appreciable performance boosts and narrowed multi-core performance gap with the Apple A13 Bionic'
		,'Coming soon to an Android flagship near you. Qualcomm''s latest flagship SoC is now official, and on the sidelines of the recent launch event we had a chance to test out the Snapdragon 865 in action. We compare the Snapdragon 865 in Qualcomm''s reference device with the Snapdragon 855, 855+, Apple A13 Bionic, and the Kirin 990 to see the kind of performance improvements one can expect when new Android flagships launch next year.'
		,'Earlier this month, Qualcomm unveiled its latest Snapdragon SoC lineup that includes the flagship Snapdragon 865 and the upper mid-range Snapdragon 765/765G. During the event, we got a chance to take the Snapdragon 865 (SD 865) for a short test drive on a Qualcomm reference device. Here are the results of some of the benchmarks and a comparative analysis of how good the new SoC is, compared to the Snapdragon 855 (SD 855) and Snapdragon 855+ (SD 855+).

Note: All tests were run with Performance Mode turned on. Performance Mode does not boost clocks but offers faster clock ramping and shifts the load from little to big cores faster. OEM devices may change how Performance Mode is implemented depending on battery life targets. 

CPU benchmarks
For testing the CPU, we ran AnTuTu v8 and Geekbench 5. Overall system performance was measured using the PCMark for Android Work 2.0 test. In AnTuTu v8, we see up to a 15% increase in the total score compared to the SD 855+ while there is a substantial increase by about 48% compared to the SD 855. Similarly, the CPU-only score shows a respectable 25% improvement over the SD 855+ and nearly a 60% lead over the SD 855. 

In Geekbench single core, the SD 865 scores 932 points, a 29% improvement over the SD 855 in the Google Pixel 4 and a 22% improvement over the SD 855+ in the Asus ROG Phone 2. In multi-core, the SD 865 shows about a 37% improvement over the SD 855 and SD 855+. Interestingly, the performance gap with the 855+ was comparatively narrower when the OnePlus 7T Pro is considered. Compute performance seems to be up by a decent 15% compared to the SD 855. 

The Apple A13 Bionic has traditionally been the leader when it comes to mobile SoCs and this holds true even now. However, Qualcomm has been able to bridge the gap significantly in multi-core Geekbench, coming within 4% of the A13 Bionic. The A13 is still the leader when it comes to raw single-core scores. The SD 865 handily beats the Kirin 990 in the Huawei Mate 30 Pro in both single-core and multi-core tests. 

The SD 865 also brings overall boosts in productivity as evidenced by the 20% increase in PCMark Work 2.0 score compared to the SD 855 and the Kirin 990.

Qualcomm claims up to 25% performance improvement with the new Kryo 585 over the Kryo 485 in the Snapdragon 855 despite having similar clocks and we see that this holds true for the most part in these tests. The performance increase could be attributed to the IPC improvements in the Cortex-A77 chips combined with an increased L3 cache (4 MB).'
